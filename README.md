#Find a show!

##An app which will allow you to find shows for an artist near a certain geocoordinate.
####Basically a songkick.com clone.

[showmevents.herokuapp.com](http://showmevents.herokuapp.com) 

The live site doesn't work right now (PostgreSQL isn't playing nicely with Heroku), but the site can be run locally and works like a charm! 

Consumes the last.fm API to get information on shows.

Unfortunately, I didn't have time for CSS. At least it has a consistent look and feel!
